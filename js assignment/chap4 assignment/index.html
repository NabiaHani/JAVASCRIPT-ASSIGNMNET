<h1>ANSWERS IN CONSOLE </h1>

    
    <h1>EXERCISE 4.1</h1>
    <pre>
        1.Create a variable with a Boolean value.
        2. Output the value of the variable to the console.
        3. Check whether the variable is true and if so, output a message to the console, 
        using the following syntax:
        if(myVariable){
        //action
        } 
        4. Add another if statement with an ! in front of the variable to check whether 
        the condition is not true, and create a message that will be printed to the 
        console in that instance. You should have two if statements, one with an 
        ! and the other without. You could also use an if and an else statement 
        insteadâ€”experiment!
        5. Change the variable to the opposite to see how the result changes</pre>






    <h1>EXERCISE 4.2</h1>
    <pre>
        1. Create a prompt to ask the user's age
        2. Convert the response from the prompt to a number
        3. Declare a message variable that you will use to hold the console message for 
        the user
        4. If the input age is equal to or greater than 21, set the message variable to 
        confirm entry to a venue and the ability to purchase alcohol
        5. If the input age is equal to or greater than 19, set the message variable to 
        confirm entry to the venue but deny the purchase of alcohol
        6. Provide a default else statement to set the message variable to deny entry if 
        none are true
        7. Output the response message variable to the console</pre>

    <h1>EXERCISE 4.3</h1>
     <pre>
        1. Create a Boolean value for an ID variable
        2. Using a ternary operator, create a message variable that will check whether 
        their ID is valid and either allow a person into a venue or not
        3. Output the response to the console</pre>







    <h1>EXERCISE 4.4</h1>
    <pre>
     As discussed in Chapter 1, Getting Started with JavaScript, the JavaScript function Math.
    random() will return a random number in the range of 0 to less than 1, including 0 
    but not 1. You can then scale it to the desired range by multiplying the result and 
    using Math.floor() to round it down to the nearest whole number; for example, to 
    generate a random number between 0 and 9:
    // random number between 0 and 1
    let randomNumber = Math.random(); 
    // multiply by 10 to obtain a number between 0 and 10
    randomNumber = randomNumber * 10; 
    // removes digits past decimal place to provide a whole number
    RandomNumber = Math.floor(randomNumber); 
    In this exercise, we'll create a Magic 8-Ball random answer generator:
    1. Start by setting a variable that gets a random value assigned to it. The value 
    is assigned by generating a random number 0-5, for 6 possible results. You 
    can increase this number as you add more results.
    2. Create a prompt that can get a string value input from a user that you can 
    repeat back in the final output.
    3. Create 6 responses using the switch statement, each assigned to a different 
    value from the random number generator. 
    4. Create a variable to hold the end response, which should be a sentence 
    printed for the user. You can assign different string values for each case, 
    assigning new values depending on the results from the random value.
    5. Output the user's original question, plus the randomly selected case 
    response, to the console after the user enters their question</pre>






    <h1>EXERCISE 4.5</h1>
    <pre>
        1. Create a variable called prize and use a prompt to ask the user to set the 
        value by selecting a number between 0 and 10
        2. Convert the prompt response to a number data type
        3. Create a variable to use for the output message containing the value "My 
        Selection: "
        4. Using the switch statement (and creativity), provide a response back 
        regarding a prize that is awarded depending on what number is selected
        5. Use the switch break to add combined results for prizes
        6. Output the message back to the user by concatenating your prize variable 
        strings and the output message string</pre>


    <h1>"CHAPTER PROJECTS"</h1>
    <h2>'EVALUATING A NUMBER GAME'</h2>   
    <pre> 
        Ask the user to enter a number and check whether it's greater than, equal to, or less 
        than a dynamic number value in your code. Output the result to the user</pre> 



    <h2>'Friend checker game'</h2>
    <pre>Ask the user to enter a name, using the switch statement to return a confirmation 
    that the user is a friend if the name selected is known in the case statements. You 
    can add a default response that you don't know the person if it's an unknown name. 
    Output the result into the console</pre>    



    <h2>'ROCK PAPER SCISSCORS GAME'</h2>
    <pre>
        This is a game between a player and the computer, where both will make a random 
        selection of either Rock, Paper, or Scissors (alternatively, you could create a version 
        using real player input!). Rock will beat out Scissors, Paper will beat out Rock, and 
        Scissors will beat out Paper. You can use JavaScript to create your own version of 
        this game, applying the logic with an if statement. Since this project is a little more 
        difficult, here are some suggested steps:
        1. Create an array that contains the variables Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
        2. Set up a variable that generates a random number 0-2 for the player and then 
        do the same for the computer's selection. The number represents the index 
        values in the array of the 3 items.
        3. Create a variable to hold a response message to the user. This can show the 
        random results for the player and then also the result for the computer of the 
        matching item from the array. 
        4. Create a condition to handle the player and computer selections. If both are 
        the same, this results in a tie. 
        5. Use conditions to apply the game logic and return the correct results. 
        There are several ways to do this with the condition statements, but you 
        could check which player's index value is bigger and assign the victory 
        accordingly, with the exception of Rock beating Scissors.
        6. Add a new output message that shows the player selection versus the 
        computer selection and the result of the game</pre>
